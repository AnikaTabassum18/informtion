International Students  :</strong> </h3><p><strong>
Individuals who are not citizens or permanent residents of Bangladesh are defined as international applicants. International applicants seeking admission into EU must meet the same academic standards as those required for Bangladeshi students. There are wide variations, however, among educational systems throughout the world that make an exact comparison of educational standards difficult. International applicants who cannot sit for admission test are selected on the basis of their prior academic results, English proficiency, probability of success in the chosen curriculum as evidenced by prior work in the academic area involved, and certification of adequate financial resources.<strong></p><h3 style="color:blue"class="text-center">
            Transfer Students       :</h3><p><strong>
Transfer students are expected to have at least a 2.50 CGPA on a 4-point scale at the University level programs to be considered for admission to Eastern University. They have to sit for and pass the Admission Test unless waived by EU Authority. 
Catalogs and official transcripts from previously attended Universities must be furnished with the application for admission. If needed, transcripts may have to be sent directly to the EU Registrar's Office from each institution attended. An undergraduate student may transfer (through grade transfer or course exemption or a combination of both) a maximum of 35 percent of the total credit hours required for the degree in question at EU. In exceptional cases, the Equivalence Committee may, on recommendation of concerned Dean, consider extending the credits up to 40 percent. Courses with C+ grades as per Eastern University standard may be considered for transfer or exemption. For the purpose of transferring credits, the Equivalence Committee of the Uni?ersity determines equivalence of courses and grades for each transfer student. The curriculum, evaluation system and grading standard of the university from which the student is transferring must be comparable to those of Eastern University which reserves the right to make final decision on transfer.</strong> </p><h3 style="color:blue"class="text-center">
		Provisional Admission       :</h3><p> <strong>
Students who have appeared at the last required examination for admission may apply for provisional admission. Every student must submit the required certificates and other documents at the time of admission. Applicants seeking admission who are not able to produce one or more documents at the time of admission may be admitted provisionally. All provisionally admitted students are required to submit appropriate documents within a given deadline as a prerequisite for continued enrollment. 
</strong> </p><h3 style="color:blue"class="text-center">
           Non-degree Students     :</h3><p><strong>
A student of another university or equivalent educational institution may register in courses as non-degree student on payment of requisite fees for such students. The total number of courses s/he may register in shall not exceed 50 percent of the courses required for the degree. 
</strong></p><h3 style="color:blue"class="text-center"><strong>
Course Waiver/Exemption for Graduate Students    :</strong></h3><p><strong>
A graduate student with undergraduate degree from Eastern University may get waiver or exemption of courses to a maximum of 50% of the total credits required for the degree. A graduate student with undergraduate degree from other universities may get waiver or exemption of courses to a maximum of 35% of the total credits required for the degree. In exceptional cases, the limit may be raised to 40% by the appropriate authority. Transcripts and other supporting documents must be submitted with the application for exemption/waiver. 
A student may apply for exemption from courses of other universities in which s/he has at least B – grades and the course contents match at least up to 85% with the contents of the corresponding course at EU.</strong> </p>
    <h3 style="color:blue"class="text-center"><strong>Student Identification      :</strong></h3><p class="text-center">  <strong>
Card A new student receives, upon admission, an identification (ID) card with a unique number. This card is used for entering and staying in the campus, attending classes, using the library, internet and computer services, etc. The students must take good care of the ID and must report of its loss, if any, to the Registrar’s Office immediately so that the card can be cancelled to prevent its misuse. The Registrar’s Office will issue a duplicate ID Card upon application and payment of fees by the student. A student is liable to pay for any loss incurred by the University for the missing the card. 
</strong></p>    

 <h3 style="color:blue"class="text-center"><strong>Orientation   :</strong></h3><p class="text-center"><strong>
All new students must participate in the orientation program at the beginning of the semester. Students are encouraged to bring along their parents / guardians to the orientation ceremony.
